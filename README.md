# 🌲 Forest Explorer

**Forest Explorer** is an immersive, photorealistic 3D vocabulary gamification experience built with React and Three.js. Navigate a lush, living ecosystem to discover ancient words and unlock the secrets of the forest.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎨 Photorealistic Visuals
- **Grounded Foliage**: 10,000+ hyper-realistic grass blades with organic tapering and light-passing (translucency) effects.
- **Mastery-Level Trees**: Procedurally generated ancient trees with noise-displaced trunks and volumetric foliage clusters.
- **Cinematic Pipeline**: High-fidelity post-processing including Bloom, ACES Filmic Tone Mapping, and N8AO for deep, realistic shadows.

### 🎵 Immersive Soundscape
- **Avian Synthesis 2.0**: A procedural auditory ecosystem featuring three distinct bird species (Chirpers, Warblers, and Woodpeckers) that harmonize in real-time.
- **Adaptive Ambient**: Dynamic bursts of birdsong that respond to your movement through the woods.

### 🎮 Advanced Mechanics
- **Macro Camera & Free Rotation**: 360° orbit controls and increased scale for a dramatic, cinematic sense of exploration.
- **X-Ray Visibility**: Intelligently fading trees that ensure the character is never obscured in dense foliage.
- **Cinematic Loading**: A custom-styled loading experience that tracks asset readiness for a smooth, flicker-free entry.

### 💎 Educational Gameplay
- **Vocabulary Quests**: Find hidden treasures to unlock words like *Lush*, *Canopy*, and *Symbiosis*.
